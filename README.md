End-to-End Machine Learning & Geospatial Optimization System

An AI-powered system designed to predict food surplus generation from restaurants and optimize donation routes to NGOs using real-world Pune city datasets, machine learning, and geospatial analytics.
The system is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application for real-time visualization and decision support.

 Key Highlights

Uses real municipal, restaurant, and NGO datasets — no synthetic data

Performs city-scale geospatial analysis to identify food surplus hotspots

Applies machine learning with surrogate target modeling to predict surplus intensity

Integrates ward-level waste data to improve realism and calibration

Detects high-impact donation zones using clustering and density analysis

Matches surplus restaurants with nearest NGOs using distance-based optimization

Generates optimized donation routes to minimize travel distance and time

Provides interactive maps and dashboards via Streamlit

Computes impact metrics such as average route distance and estimated CO₂ reduction

Built with a modular, production-ready ML pipeline that can scale to other cities
