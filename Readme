# City-Level Food Waste Prediction & Intelligent Donation Routing

**One-line:** Predict surplus food at city zones and optimize donation routing to NGOs — end-to-end ML + geospatial + optimization + deployment.

## Features
- Synthetic + real data ingestion
- Zone-level surplus forecasting (XGBoost + LSTM)
- Hotspot detection (Clustering)
- Vehicle routing optimizer (OR-Tools)
- Interactive dashboard (Streamlit)
- Dockerized deployment + reproducible experiments

## Quick start
1. Clone repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Generate synthetic data: `python synthetic_data_generator.py`
4. Train XGBoost: `python src/train_xgb.py`
5. Run API: `uvicorn src.api.app:app --reload`
6. Start dashboard: `streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py`

Pune Food Waste Prediction & Intelligent Donation Routing
End-to-End Machine Learning + Geospatial Optimization System

An AI-powered system that predicts food surplus from restaurants and optimizes donation routes to NGOs using real Pune city datasets, geospatial analytics, machine learning, and route optimization — deployed as an interactive Streamlit application.

Project Overview

Food wastage is a major urban challenge, while many NGOs struggle with inconsistent food supply.
This project bridges that gap by building an end-to-end intelligent system that:

Predicts food surplus potential at restaurant level

Identifies high-impact surplus hotspots using geospatial clustering

Matches surplus restaurants with nearby NGOs

Optimizes donation routes to minimize distance and time

Visualizes everything in a live interactive web app

 City Focus: Pune, India
 Data: Real restaurant, NGO, and municipal solid-waste datasets
 Impact: Reduced food wastage, faster donation logistics, lower CO₂ emissions
